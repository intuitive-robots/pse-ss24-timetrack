# Intuitive Time Tracking Web-App for Research Assistants

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for a web application designed to simplify and streamline the process of time tracking for research assistants (HiWis) at Intuitive Robots Lab. The application facilitates accurate recording of work hours and ensures compliance with institutional regulations.

## Features

- **Time Entry**: Users can log their daily work hours, including start and end times, and break durations.
- **Vacation Management**: Users can request vacation days, view pending requests, and track their remaining vacation entitlement.
- **Signature Verification**: At the end of each month, users can sign their timesheets electronically, making them ready for supervisor review.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can view and update their personal information, change their password, and manage their login credentials.
- **Contract Overview**: Displays detailed contract information including assigned weekly work hours, contract start date, team details, hourly rate, and supervisor contact information.
- **Digital Signature Upload**: Users can upload a digital image of their signature for use in official documents and timesheet verification.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Backend**: Python Flask serves as the backend framework, handling API requests, business logic, and data management.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user data, work records, and vacation information.
- **API Communication**: REST API endpoints facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different development and production environments.
